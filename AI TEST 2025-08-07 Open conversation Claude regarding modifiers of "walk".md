how would you say "stop walking" in Anishinaabemowin

In Anishinaabemowin (Ojibwe), "stop walking" would typically be expressed as:

**"Gego bimosen"** (geh-go BIM-oh-sen)

This breaks down as:

- **Gego** = don't, stop (negative imperative)
- **Bimosen** = walk (you walk)

You might also hear variations like:

- **"Ishkwaa-bimosen"** = stop walking (literally "finish walking")
- **"Giizhikan"** = stop it/stop that (more general)

The exact form can vary depending on the specific dialect of Anishinaabemowin, as there are regional differences across Ojibwe, Odawa, and Potawatomi communities. The pronunciation and spelling systems can also differ between communities.

how about using the word "boon"

Ah yes! Using **"boon"** (stop/quit), you could say:

**"Boon bimosen"** (boon BIM-oh-sen)

This would be "stop walking" using the imperative form of "boon" (to stop/quit) followed by "bimosen" (walking).

You might also see it written as:

- **"Booni-bimosen"** - with the connecting vowel
- **"Boonin bimosen"** - depending on the dialect and grammatical construction

"Boon" is indeed a common way to express "stop" or "quit" in Anishinaabemowin, and it's often used in commands or requests to cease an activity. The exact pronunciation and spelling can vary between different Ojibwe communities and their orthographic systems.

why do you say bimosen instead of bimose

Good question! The difference between "bimose" and "bimosen" relates to Ojibwe verb conjugation.

**"Bimose"** is the basic verb stem meaning "to walk"

**"Bimosen"** is the second person form meaning "you walk"

So when saying "stop walking" as a command to someone, you're telling _them_ to stop walking, which requires the "you" form of the verb. That's why it's:

**"Boon bimosen"** = "Stop walking" (literally "stop you-walk")

If you were talking about walking in general or using it differently, you might use other forms:

- **"Bimose"** = he/she walks
- **"Nibimose"** = I walk
- **"Gibimose"** = you walk (different conjugation pattern)

The "-n" ending in "bimosen" is a marker for the second person in this particular verb form. Ojibwe verbs change their endings based on who is doing the action, similar to how we might say "I walk" vs "he walks" in English, but much more extensively.

so how would you say "stop driving" and what is the verb stem for driving

For "stop driving," the verb stem for driving in Anishinaabemowin is **"daashkikaw"** (to drive/operate a vehicle).

So "stop driving" would be:

**"Boon daashkikawing"** or **"Boon daashkikawen"**

The verb stem **"daashkikaw"** comes from the concept of operating or controlling a vehicle. You might also see variations like:

- **"daashkikaa"** - another form of the driving verb
- **"gichi-jiimaan daashkikaw"** - literally "big boat drive" (for driving cars, as cars were conceptualized as land boats)

The exact conjugation can vary:

- **"Nindaashkikaw"** = I drive
- **"Gidaashkikaw"** = you drive
- **"Daashkikaw"** = he/she drives

So the command form would use the appropriate second person ending with "boon" to create "stop driving."

I should note that there can be regional variations in vocabulary, and some communities might use different terms for modern concepts like driving, depending on how these words were adopted or created in their particular dialect.
