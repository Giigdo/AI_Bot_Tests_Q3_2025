However, if you mean ""bundle"" in a ceremonial or spiritual context (such as a sacred medicine bundle), the term and its pronunciation can vary by community and dialect. Some Anishinaabe speakers use makak (ᒪᑲᐠ) for a container or box that might hold a bundle, while others have distinct ceremonial terms that are not shared publicly due to cultural protocols.","The Ojibwe word for ""bundle"" (noun) is ""babagiwayaan"" (pronounced bah-bah-gi-wah-yahn).
This word specifically refers to a bundle or package of things wrapped together. In Ojibwe culture, bundles often have spiritual significance, particularly sacred bundles used in ceremonies, though the word itself can refer to any bundle of wrapped items.
There may be some dialectal variations in spelling and pronunciation across different Ojibwe communities, as Ojibwe has several regional dialects."
W002,gull,noun,gayaashk,Rama First Nation Ojibwe Language Dictionary,gikendang,gikii'igani,"English: ""gull"" (noun) Ojibwe: ""gaagaagi"" Pronunciation: [gah-gah-gee] Notes: ""Gaagaagi"" is the term used for a gull, a type of seabird, in Ojibwe.","In Ojibwe, the general word for “gull” (the bird) is gayaashk (ᑲᔮᔥᐠ).

gayaashk — often refers to a seagull or similar waterbird

Plural: gayaashkog (ᑲᔮᔥᑯᐠ)

This term is fairly widespread across many dialects, though the exact pronunciation can shift slightly between communities. Some dialects may also have more specific names for different gull species.","The Ojibwe word for ""gull"" (the bird) is ""giizhigokwe"" (pronounced gee-zhee-go-kway).
This word literally translates to something like ""sky woman"" or ""heavenly woman"" - ""giizhig"" meaning sky/heaven and ""-okwe"" being a suffix relating to woman/female."
W003,son,noun,ngwis,Rama First Nation Ojibwe Language Dictionary,nindinawemagak,niin,"English: ""son"" (noun) Ojibwe: ""gwis"" Pronunciation: [gwis] Notes: ""Gwis"" is the term used for ""son"" in Ojibwe, referring to a male child.","In many Ojibwe dialects, the noun son (in the possessed form) is:

nidoo'aanh — my son

gid oo'aanh — your son

odoo'aanh — his/her son

Ojibwe kinship terms are usually possessed by nature — you don’t just say “son” without saying whose son it is. That’s because in Ojibwe worldview and grammar, family roles exist in relation to someone.

If you wanted to speak of “a son” in a more general way (like in English), speakers might still use the third-person possessed form odoo'aanh, meaning “someone’s son.”","The Ojibwe word for ""son"" is ""ogichidaa"" when referring to a young man or son in general.
However, Ojibwe typically uses possessive forms when talking about family relationships, so more commonly you would hear:

""ningwis"" - my son (first person)
""kigwis"" - your son (second person)
""ogwisan"" - his/her son (third person)

The root ""gwis"" refers to son, but it's almost always used with possessive prefixes in actual speech, as Ojibwe grammar emphasizes the relational aspect of family terms.
There may be some dialectal variations in spelling and pronunciation across different Ojibwe communities."
W004,daughter,noun,ndaanis,Rama First Nation Ojibwe Language Dictionary,nindizhinikaaz,gwiiwi,"English: ""daughter"" (noun) Ojibwe: ""gwiizens"" Pronunciation: [gwee-zens] Notes: ""Gwiizens"" is the term used for ""daughter"" in Ojibwe, referring to a female child.

Do you have more English text you would like translated into Ojibwe?","In many Ojibwe dialects, daughter is expressed the same way as other close kinship terms — with a possessive prefix:

nindaanis — my daughter

gidaanis — your daughter

odaanis — his/her daughter

Like “son,” you don’t usually say “daughter” in isolation in Ojibwe; you say whose daughter it is. To speak of “a daughter” in a general sense, people might use odaanis, which literally means “someone’s daughter.”","The Ojibwe word for ""daughter"" uses the root ""danis"" but is typically expressed with possessive prefixes:

""nindaanis"" - my daughter (first person)
""kidaanis"" - your daughter (second person)
""odaanisan"" - his/her daughter (third person)

Like with ""son,"" Ojibwe grammar emphasizes the relational aspect of family terms, so you'll rarely hear ""daughter"" without indicating whose daughter is being referenced.
The root ""danis"" refers to daughter, but it's almost always used with these possessive prefixes in actual speech."

gidaakozi — you are sick

The word changes with person prefixes: nin- for “I,” gi- for “you,” and o- (or no prefix) for “he/she.”

Some dialects may have slight pronunciation changes, such as aakosii or aakosi.","The Ojibwe word for ""to be sick"" is ""aakozi"" (pronounced ah-ah-ko-zee).
This is a verb that means ""to be sick"" or ""to be ill."" In Ojibwe, like other family relationship terms, verbs are conjugated to show who is performing the action:

""nindaakoz"" - I am sick
""gidaakoz"" - you are sick
""aakozi"" - he/she is sick

The root ""aakozi"" can also be used to form related words about sickness and health in Ojibwe"

bagosenim — to change oneself into something / transform

bagosenjige — to cause something to transform

bagosendam — to change one’s mind (mental transformation)

W007,busy,verb,jaanmizi,Rama First Nation Ojibwe Language Dictionary,nashke,busy,"English: ""busy"" Ojibwe: ""endamawiz"" Pronunciation: [en-dah-mah-wiz] Notes: ""Endamawiz"" is used to describe someone who is busy or occupied with tasks in Ojibwe.","In Ojibwe, a common word for “busy” is azhaawebizi (pronounced roughly ah-zhah-weh-bih-zee).

azhaawebizi — he/she is busy

nindazhaawebizi — I am busy

gidazhaawebizi — you are busy

Some dialects may shorten or vary this form slightly, and in some communities you might also hear bimaadizi (“he/she lives” or “is engaged in life”) used in certain contexts to imply someone is occupied.","The Ojibwe word for ""busy"" is ""animkii"" or ""animki"" (pronounced ah-nim-kee).
This verb means ""to be busy"" or ""to be active/working hard."" It conjugates like other Ojibwe verbs:

""nindanimkii"" - I am busy
""gidanimkii"" - you are busy
""animkii"" - he/she is busy

There's also ""gizhiitaa"" which can mean ""to be busy"" in the sense of being accomplished or skilled at keeping busy with tasks."

nindonaabani — I buy (it)

This is a transitive verb, meaning it requires a direct object (something being bought). It conjugates as:

""ningishpinaa"" - I buy it
""gigishpinaa"" - you buy it
""gishpinaan"" - he/she buys it

There's also ""adaawge"" which means ""to trade"" or ""to do business/commerce,"" which was historically more common before the introduction of money-based economies.
Another related word is ""gishpinaage"" which refers to the act of buying or purchasing in general."
W009,to dislike,verb,zhiingenmaa,Rama First Nation Ojibwe Language Dictionary,gaawii'awai,Gikinawenh,"English: ""to dislike"" Ojibwe: ""gaawiin minwendanzi"" Pronunciation: [gah-wee-n min-wen-dahn-zee] Notes: ""Gaawiin minwendanzi"" is a phrase used in Ojibwe to express the concept of disliking something.","In Ojibwe, a common verb for “to dislike” is awiiyaakamigiziwin or more simply gawiin izhaadizisii depending on dialect and style — but here’s the more typical root:

gawiin niminwendanziin — I do not like it (literally: “I am not pleased by it”)

gawiin giminnwendanziin — you do not like it

gawiin ominwendanziin — he/she does not like it

Ojibwe often expresses “dislike” as “not like” rather than a separate single word.
There’s no single universal standalone verb meaning only “to dislike” in the way English has; instead, it’s a negative form of minwendam (“to like/be pleased”).","The Ojibwe word for ""to dislike"" is ""gishkendaan"" (pronounced gish-ken-dahn) when referring to disliking something, or ""gishkenim"" (gish-ken-im) when referring to disliking someone.
These conjugate as:
For disliking something:

""ningishkendaan"" - I dislike it
""gigishkendaan"" - you dislike it
""gishkendaan"" - he/she dislikes it

For disliking someone:

""ningishkenmaa"" - I dislike him/her
""gigishkenmaa"" - you dislike him/her
""gishkenmaan"" - he/she dislikes him/her

There's also ""minwendanzii"" which means ""to not like"" or ""to not enjoy"" something (literally the negative form of ""minwendam"" - to like/enjoy)."

Ozhaawashkwaa (pronounced oh-zhah-wahsh-kwaah) — describes something that is green in color.

Ozhaawashkwaa’ow — verb form meaning ""it is green"" (often used for inanimate subjects like leaves or clothing).

If you mean ""be green"" in an environmental sense (like ""be eco-friendly""), Ojibwe would usually express that idea with a fuller phrase rather than a direct translation — something like bizaan aki (""the earth is peaceful/undisturbed"") or aki nishkaadiziwin (""earth-respecting way""), depending on dialect and speaker preference.","The Ojibwe word for ""to be green"" is ""ozhaawashko"" (pronounced oh-zhah-wah-shko).

""ozhaawashko-mitig"" - green tree/wood
""ozhaawashko-nibi"" - green water

It's worth noting that in traditional Ojibwe color terminology, the distinction between blue and green wasn't always as strict as in English, so ""ozhaawashko"" can sometimes refer to blue-green colors.
For specifically plant-green or the green of growing things, you might also hear ""ozhaawashkozi""."

This breaks down as:
