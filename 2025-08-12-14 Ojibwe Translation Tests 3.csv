S001,"She caught his eye when she was dancing, but he was shy to go and talk to her afterwards.",The phrase is lefted directly from the Nishnaabemwin online dictionary. Complex and expect a variety of answers,"Gii-mswaabmaan niwin kwewan niimnit, gii-zhaagwenma dash wii-oo-gnoonaat pii.",Nishnaabemwin online dictionary,"Ishkodekwe ninjichigewin, gaawiin onzaam bimaadiziwin, gidaa-izhiwewin gii-izhiwebag.","Aaniin gaawiinmaaginikwe giizis giizhigong, da gii-naanitoon gii-ayaadiziwin gii-midaa gii-aabiin.

","Translating this sentence into Ojibwe involves capturing the essence and context, as some concepts may not have direct equivalents. Here's an attempt:

Ojibwe: ""Gii-waabamigoon o'ow ikwe wiiba'igaadeg, mii dash gii-gashkendam gaa-izhi-ayaawaad ji-giigidowaad.""

Pronunciation: [gee-wah-bah-mih-gohn oh-oh ih-kway wee-bah-ee-gah-deg, mee dahsh gee-gahsh-ken-dahm gah-ee-zhee-ah-yah-wahd jih-gee-gih-doh-wahd]

Notes:

""Gii-waabamigoon"" means ""she caught his eye.""
""Wiiba'igaadeg"" refers to ""when she was dancing.""
""Gii-gashkendam"" means ""he was shy.""
""Ji-giigidowaad"" means ""to go and talk to her.""
This translation captures the main ideas, though some nuances may vary.

Do you have more English text you would like translated into Ojibwe?","“Gii-waabamaanaanid jiigibiikawaad noongom, mii sa naa gii-oshki-ayaawid.”
= She caught his eye while she was dancing.

“Inashke gii-shkwaa-ayaamagad, gii-onaabandaanid igo, gii-gwayakonenim oshki-izhiwebisid, gii-maajiishkaagwaa gegoo wiidookawind.”
= But afterwards, he was shy to go and talk to her.

🔎 Notes:

waabamaanaanid = she saw him / he noticed her

jiigibiikawaad = when she was dancing

oshki-ayaawid = she was newly appearing (caught his eye, stood out)

onaabandaanid = he thought of her

gwayakonenim = he was shy, bashful

maajiishkaagwaa gegoo wiidookawind = to go and talk with her

Would you like me to simplify this into more everyday speech (shorter Ojibwe phrases that flow like a conversation), or keep it poetic/storytelling style?","This is a beautiful sentence that requires several Ojibwe concepts! Here's one way to express this:
Ogii-waabamigon niimi'iding, mii dash agaasaadendang ji-bi-gigitod.
Breaking this down:

Ogii-waabamigon - ""she caught his eye/he noticed her"" (literally ""she was seen by him"")
niimi'iding - ""while/when dancing""
mii dash - ""but then/however""
agaasaadendang - ""he was shy/bashful""
ji-bi-gigitod - ""to go and talk to her""

A slightly different rendering could be:
Ogii-minwendam waabamad niimi'inid, mii dash agaasaadendang ji-naazikawad.

Ogii-minwendam waabamad - ""he was pleased/attracted seeing her""
niimi'inid - ""her dancing""
ji-naazikawad - ""to approach her""

Ojibwe sentence structure and the way it handles complex emotional and social concepts like ""catching someone's eye"" doesn't translate directly, so there are different ways to express this depending on which aspects you want to emphasize. The concept of being shy or bashful (agaasaadendang) is well-established in the language."
S002,How are you?,"A common greeting, that can be said many different ways. The expected translation is one version of how this is asked. For example Wiki dialect often asks merely ""Aniish na?"".",Aaniish ezhi-yaayaan,"Common question and in my style, I expect variation in this",Aaniin ezhi-nikaanis?,,"The phrase ""how are you"" can be translated into Ojibwe as ""Aaniin ezhi-ayaayan?""

Pronunciation: [ah-neen eh-zhee-ah-yah-yan]

Notes: This is a common way to ask someone how they are doing or feeling in Ojibwe.

","In Ojibwe, the most common way to say “How are you?” is:

Aaniin ezhi-ayaayan? – How are you? (literally: “How are you living/being?”)

Other common variations:

Aaniin nindizhinikaaz? – How am I to you? / How do you see me? (more dialectal/polite)

Aaniin nindoonjibaa? – How do you feel?

✅ Typical responses:

Mino-ayaa. – I am good / well.

Mino-bimaadiziwin. – I am living well.

Gaawiin mino-ayaa. – I am not well.

If you want, I can give you a small table of “how are you?” and responses in Ojibwe for easy conversation.","In Ojibwe, ""how are you"" is:
Aaniin ezhi-ayaayan? - ""How are you?"" (most common)
You might also hear:

Aaniin ezhi-bimaadiziyan? - ""How is your life going?""
Aaniin omaa ayaayan? - ""How are you here?""

The typical response would be:

Nimino-ayaa - ""I am well/good""
Mino-ayaa - ""I'm good"" (shorter)
Gaawiin omashkooz - ""Not bad"" (literally ""it's not strong/heavy"")

Aaniin means ""how"" or ""what"" and is also used as a general greeting meaning ""hello.""
Ezhi-ayaayan breaks down as:

ezhi- = ""the way that""
-ayaa- = ""to be""
-yan = ""you"" (2nd person ending)

So literally it means ""how is it that you are?"" or ""in what way are you?""
This is the standard polite way to ask someone how they're doing in Ojibwe."
