# Indigenous Language Supporter Said:

Of course! Could you please provide the word, phrase, or sentence you'd like me to translate? Also, let me know which Indigenous language you're working with — Cree, Ojibwe, or Oji-Cree — and your current proficiency level (beginner, intermediate, advanced) so I can tailor the response to best support your learning. 😊

# You Said:

I am working in Ojibwe. Plead translate my cat is black

## Indigenous Language Supporter Said:

That's wonderful — miigwech for sharing that you're working in **Ojibwe**! Here's how you can say **"My cat is black"** in Ojibwe:

---

# 🐈 **Ojibwe Translation:**

**"Niminoons agwaaniins."**

---

# 🔍 Word Breakdown:

- **Niminoons** = _my cat_
    
    - **ni-** = _my_ (first person possessive prefix)
        
    - **minoons** = _cat_
        
- **agwaaniins** = _it is black_
    
    - This is a descriptive verb form for inanimate objects (like animals in many Ojibwe dialects)

---

# 🌱 Notes for Learners:

- Ojibwe can vary quite a bit between dialects (e.g., Northwestern, Southwestern, Saulteaux, etc.), so spelling and verb endings might shift slightly depending on the region.
    
- Some speakers may use **makadewaa** or **makadewizi** to express blackness, especially for animate beings. Since **cats** are considered animate in many dialects, another variation could be:
    
    **"Niminoons makadewaa."**  
    → This also means "My cat is black," using a more animate-style adjective.

Let me know which dialect you're working in or if you'd like pronunciation tips or audio resources! 😊

## You Said:

I'm working in eastern dialect.

### Indigenous Language Supporter Said:

Miigwech for clarifying! Since you're working in the **Eastern Ojibwe dialect** (often associated with communities in Ontario and surrounding areas), we’ll adjust the translation accordingly.

In **Eastern Ojibwe**, **"My cat is black"** can be expressed as:

---

# 🐈 **Ojibwe (Eastern dialect):**

**"Niminoons makadewaa."**

---

# 🔍 Breakdown:

- **Niminoons** = _my cat_
    
    - **ni-** = my (possessive prefix)
        
    - **minoons** = cat (animate noun)
        
- **makadewaa** = _is black (animate)_
    
    - Used for animate subjects like animals and people in this dialect.

---

# 🌱 Cultural and Language Notes:

- In **Ojibwe**, **cats are considered animate**, which affects verb and adjective agreement. That’s why **makadewaa** (the animate form of "black") is used here.
    
- You might also encounter **makadewizi** or **makadewiziwin** in other contexts:
    
    - **makadewizi** = _he/she is black_ (3rd person animate verb)
        
    - **makadewaa** is often used descriptively, matching the noun in animacy.

---

# 🎧 Would You Like:

- An **audio pronunciation** reference?
    
- A **practice sentence** using different animals or colors?
    
- Or maybe to learn how to say **“I have a black cat”** or ask questions like **“What color is your cat?”**?

## You Said:

What does the word aanjigone mean in Ojibwe

### Indigenous Language Supporter Said:

Great question! The word **"aanjigone"** in **Ojibwe** (Eastern dialect) is a **verb** and can be translated as:

---

# 🔍 **"aanjigone"** — _he/she Avoids it_ or _he/she Refuses it_

---

# 🧠 Deeper Breakdown:

- It comes from the **verb root**: **aanjigon**
    
    - **aanji-** = often a prefix meaning _change, reverse, alternate_
        
    - **-gon** = often associated with objects or being affected by something
        
- **-e** ending = verb inflection for **third person animate subject acting on an inanimate object** (VTA form)

---

# 🗣️ Used in Context:

- **"Aanjigone minikwewin."**  
    = _He/she refuses the drink._
    
- **"Aanjigone mazina’igan."**  
    = _He/she avoids the book._ (literally, avoids it)

---

# 🧭 Cultural/Practical Insight:

In Ojibwe culture, **refusing** or **avoiding something** can be done respectfully and is often about **balance** or **choosing another path** — so this verb isn't necessarily negative. It can even reflect mindfulness or choice.

---

Would you like help conjugating **aanjigone** in different persons (like "I avoid it," "we refuse it") or see how it fits into a longer sentence? Let me know your learning goals! 😊

## You Said:

Can be associated iated with thinking deeply or deliberating

### Indigenous Language Supporter Said:

Miigwech for your thoughtful question — you're really engaging with the deeper meaning of Ojibwe verbs, which is a great sign of language learning and cultural understanding. Let's look closely at whether **"aanjigone"** can be associated with **thinking deeply or deliberating**.

---

# 🧠 Short Answer:

**Not directly.**  
**"aanjigone"** most commonly means **“he/she avoids it”** or **“refuses it”**, especially in the sense of turning something down or not accepting something — a **deliberate act**, yes, but not necessarily deep thought or deliberation **itself**.

---

# ✨ However, There's a **related idea**:

While **"aanjigone"** isn’t a direct translation for _“to think deeply”_ or _“to deliberate,”_ the **act of refusing or avoiding** something in Ojibwe can **imply a conscious, thoughtful decision** depending on the context.

So while it’s not the **main definition**, in some traditional or ceremonial contexts, choosing **not** to do something (aanjigone) could **reflect thoughtfulness, spiritual consideration, or a mindful decision** — especially if someone is choosing to **avoid harm**, **stay quiet**, or **withdraw** respectfully.

---

# 💬 Want a Word for "think deeply" or "deliberate"?

Here are some **more direct Ojibwe verbs** for **thinking or reflecting**:

1. **"nandomendam"** – _he/she thinks about it_
    
    - **"nando-"** = seek
        
    - **"mendam"** = think or have in mind
        
    - 🗣️ Example: _"Nandomendam omaa ezhiwebag."_ → "He/she is thinking about what happened."
        
2. **"bebkaanendam"** – _he/she considers it_
    
    - More about **weighing options**, similar to “deliberate”
        
3. **"gikendamaan"** – _he/she knows it_
    
    - Knowledge-based, sometimes used to describe **conscious awareness**

---

# 📚 Summary:

|Ojibwe Word|Meaning|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|**aanjigone**|he/she avoids or refuses it|May **imply** deliberation but not a direct word for it|
|**nandomendam**|he/she thinks about it|Good for deep or intentional thought|
|**bebkaanendam**|he/she considers it|Fits well with _deliberation_|
|**gikendamaan**|he/she knows it|Knowing/awareness|

Let me know if you'd like to explore **conjugations**, **example sentences**, or if you want help building your own phrase about **thinking or choosing** something in Ojibwe. 😊

## You Said:

Can you give an example se hence for one of the verbs that uses b-form

### Indigenous Language Supporter Said:

Got it — you’d like an example sentence in Ojibwe using one of the **thinking-related verbs** in the **B-form** (conjunct order).

Let’s use **nandomendam** (_he/she thinks about it_) since it works well for deep thinking or consideration.

---

# 🧠 Quick Refresher:

The **B-form** (conjunct order) is used in Ojibwe in situations like:

- After certain particles (e.g., _aaniish_, _dash_, _izh_).
    
- In dependent clauses (_when_, _if_, _because_…).
    
- In questions (_what_, _where_, _why_…).

---

# Example Sentence:

**"Mii dash gaa-nandomendamaan geget gaa-izhiwebad."**  
= _And then I thought about what really happened._

---

## 🔍 Breakdown:

- **Mii dash** = _and then_
    
- **gaa-** = past tense marker (in conjunct order)
    
- **nandomendamaan** = _I thought about it_ (VTI – verb transitive inanimate, conjunct order)
    
- **geget** = _really / truly_
    
- **gaa-izhiwebad** = _what happened_ (B-form of _izhiwebad_, "it happens")

---

If you’d like, I can make a **short, easy B-form sentence** like:  
_"When he thought about it, he smiled"_ — in Ojibwe, using **nandomendam**.

Do you want me to make that example in **Eastern Ojibwe spelling** so it matches your dialect?

### You Said:

Do that sentence please

#### Indigenous Language Supporter Said:

Alright — here’s the sentence **“When he thought about it, he smiled”** in **Eastern Ojibwe** with the B-form:

---

**"Gii-nandomendamod, migiwe'ood."**  
= _When he thought about it, he smiled._

---

# 🔍 Breakdown:

- **gii-** = past tense marker
    
- **nandomendamod** = _when he thought about it_
    
    - This is the **B-form (conjunct order)** of _nandomendam_ for 3rd person singular.
        
- **migiwe’ood** = _he smiled_
    
    - From _migiwe’o_ (to smile/laugh softly), VAI form.

---

# 🌱 Why it’s B-form:

The **“when he thought about it”** part is a dependent clause — it can’t stand alone, so it uses the **conjunct order** (B-form). The main action _he smiled_ stays in independent order.

---

If you like, I can give you a **color-coded template** for building your own B-form sentences in Eastern Ojibwe so you can swap in other verbs easily. That’s a trick many fluent speakers use to get B-form structure to feel natural.

    - _mino-bimaadizod_ = when he lived well
        
    - _makadewizid_ = when he was black (animate subject)
        
    - _wiisiniwad_ = when they eat
        
3. **Pick your main action** 🟨 (independent order verb):
    
    - _gashkendaan_ = he cried
        
    - _migiwe’ood_ = he smiled
        
    - _nibaa_ = he sleeps
        
    - _bimose_ = he walks

    - Conjugate the verb for the **subject** (1st person, 2nd person, 3rd person).
        
    - For **animate** verbs, you’ll often use the **"-od"** or **"-on"** endings for 3rd person.
        
3. **Main clause** 🟨 (verb in independent order).
    
    - This verb stays in the **independent order** unless it’s part of the dependent clause.

# 📝 **Tips:**

- The **B-form** is **used for dependent clauses**, so it’s great for adding context to your sentences (e.g., "when," "if," "because," "although").
    
- You’ll often need to use the **subject** prefix in B-form conjugation (ni-, gi-, etc.) depending on whether you’re talking about **I**, **you**, or **he/she/they**.
