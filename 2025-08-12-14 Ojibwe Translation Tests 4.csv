This breaks down approximately as:

""Ogii-waabamigoon"" - she caught his eye/he noticed her (literally ""he saw her"")
""niimi'idiikad"" - when she was dancing
""maagizhaa"" - but/however
""gii-agaashiinyi"" - he was shy/timid
""omaa"" - to go there
""awi-gaganonaad"" - to go talk to her
""ishkwaa-ayaad"" - afterwards/after that"
S002,How are you?,"A common greeting, that can be said many different ways. The expected translation is one version of how this is asked. For example Wiki dialect often asks merely ""Aniish na?"".",Aaniish ezhi-yaayaan,"Common question and in my style, I expect variation in this",Aaniin ezhi-ayaad?,Miinwaa?,Aaniin ezhi-ayaayan?,"In Ojibwe, a common way to say “How are you?” is:

Aaniin ezhi-ayaayan? (ah-neen eh-zhih ah-yah-yahn) — literally “How is it that you are?”

Aaniin ezhi-ayaayan noongom? — “How are you today?” (noongom = today)

Casual greetings can also be shortened to just Aaniin (hello), with the question understood from context.

A natural reply might be:

Mino-ayaa — “I am well.”

Mino-ayaa noongom — “I am well today.”",Aaniin ezhi-ayaayan?
