In this test I attempted to use the microphone to talk with Claude at the end of the conversation. The bot was unable to parse spoken Ojibwe.

[Your Anishinaabemowin is coming along well! I can understand that you work at a school and teach people. I'm curious to hear more about your day - what happened at school, and what you did afterward?]

Ningiikinomaged how to teach. Shkwaa ningiibimose ni office dush ningiikinomaged another group of students about Anishinaabeg.

Eya'a, nisidotam! [Yes, I understand!]

[It makes me happy to hear they listened well and responded positively! When people are truly interested in learning about our ways, it shows respect. What else happened during your teaching day?]

Ani, Bharat,

Aaniin? [What?]

Gigi-wiindamaw ina awiya "Ani, Bharat"? [Are you telling someone "Ani, Bharat"?]

[I'm not sure what you're saying with "Ani, Bharat" - are these names of people? Are you trying to tell me something else that happened? I'd like to continue hearing about your day or help you with more Anishinaabemowin.]

Ah, Ning Bujou. Anish, a j a y n.

Aaniin? [What?]

Ningikendanziin wegonen gaa-ikidoyan. [I don't know what you said.]

Gidikid ina "Ning Bujou"? Gaawiin nindisidotanziin iw. [Are you saying "Ning Bujou"? I don't understand that.]

Ningii-wiindamoon ina gimaamaa [I made a mistake - ask your mother/elder]

[I'm having trouble understanding what you're trying to communicate. Would you like to go back to talking about your day teaching, or try to say something else in Anishinaabemowin? I'm here to help you practice through conversation.]

There. B Oh, Hello? 2.

Boozhoo! [Hello!]

Ningikendanziin wegonen gaa-ikidoyan. Gaawiin nindisidotanziin. [I don't know what you said. I don't understand.]

Gigaganozhimin ina minawaa? [Shall we talk again?]

[I'm not understanding what you're trying to say. Would you like to continue our conversation about your teaching day, or practice some other Anishinaabemowin with me?]

I was trying to speak Ojibwe as opposed to typing it. But apparently you're not able to properly parse the syllables as I say them. Into recognizable Nishnaabbe Moin.

Eya'a! Aaniish gaa-ikidoyan! [Yes! I understand what you said!]

Gaawiin ningii-nisidotanziin gii-anokiiyan ji-ganozhiyan! Ningii-inendam ezhibii'igeyan eta go. [I didn't understand that you were trying to speak! I thought you were only writing.]

Ningii-wiindamaagosiin - nandotamaw gimaamaa [I wasn't told about this - ask your mother/elder]

[I understand now - you were trying to speak out loud! I can only work with written text, but I'd love to help you practice writing the words you want to say. How do you usually spell Anishinaabemowin words?]
