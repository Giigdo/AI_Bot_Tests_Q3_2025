# You Said:

aanish pii niswokamok?

## Indigenous Language Supporter Said:

Nice question! 🙂

The phrase **“aanish pii niswokamok?”** is in **Ojibwe**. Let’s break it down:

- **aanish** – “how, how about, in what way”
    
- **pii** – “when”
    
- **niswokamok** – “at 9 o’clock” (from _niswo_ = “nine” + _-kamok_ = “at o’clock / at a time”)

So, the whole question means:  
👉 **“How about at 9 o’clock?”** or **“How is it at 9 o’clock?”**

It’s often used when arranging a time for something, like a meeting or gathering.

Would you like me to also show you how to **answer** that question in Ojibwe (e.g., “Yes, 9 o’clock works” / “No, later would be better”)?

# You Said:

aandii nipissing?

## Indigenous Language Supporter Said:

Good one! 👏

Your phrase **“aandii Nipissing?”** is in **Ojibwe**. Let’s look at it closely:

- **aandii** – means _“where?”_ or sometimes _“how are things at…?”_ depending on context.
    
- **Nipissing** – the name of a place and also the Anishinaabe people connected to Lake Nipissing (in Ontario).

So the question can mean:  
👉 **“Where is Nipissing?”** (if you’re asking about location)  
or  
👉 **“How are things in Nipissing?”** (if you’re greeting someone from there).

It’s a flexible word! Often, **aandii** is used like “how are things?” in greetings, so to a Nipissing person, this could feel like a friendly _“How’s it going in Nipissing?”_

Would you like me to show you how someone might **answer** that greeting in Ojibwe?

# You Said:

enhe,

## Indigenous Language Supporter Said:

**Enhe** — nice! ✨

That word is an **affirmative response** in Ojibwe. It’s like saying:  
👉 _“Yes” / “Okay” / “Alright then.”_

It’s often used in everyday conversation to agree with someone, to show you understand, or just to acknowledge what was said.

For example:

- A: _“Gii-wiisini na?”_ (Did you eat?)
    
- B: _“Enhe.”_ (Yes.)

Would you like me to give you a few other common **yes/okay words** in Ojibwe that you can use in different situations?

# You Said:

can you tell me where nipissing is?

## Indigenous Language Supporter Said:

Yes, absolutely. 🙂

**Nipissing** usually refers to **Lake Nipissing** and the **Nipissing First Nation** in **Ontario, Canada**.

🌊 **Lake Nipissing**

- Located in northeastern Ontario, west of the city of **North Bay**.
    
- It’s a large, shallow lake that connects to the French River, which flows into Georgian Bay.

👥 **Nipissing First Nation (Nbisiing Anishinaabeg)**

- The Nipissing people are **Anishinaabe**, closely related to Ojibwe/Odawa/Potawatomi peoples.
    
- Their traditional territory is around Lake Nipissing, and the main community today is just west of North Bay, Ontario.

📍 So if someone asks _“Aandii Nipissing?”_ in conversation, they might mean either:

- the **place** (Lake Nipissing / the community), or
    
- how things are going **with the Nipissing people**.

Would you like me to also share the **Ojibwe name** for Nipissing and what it means?

# You Said:

yes, please tell me that, what is the Ojibwe name for Nipissing and what does it mean?

## Indigenous Language Supporter Said:

Great question — this goes right to the heart of language and place! 🌊✨

The **Ojibwe name for Nipissing** is often written as **Nbisiing** (sometimes _Nbissing_ or _Nbisiin_ depending on spelling system).

🔎 **Meaning:**

- **Nbisiing** comes from **Anishinaabemowin** and means **“at the little water”** or **“small body of water.”**
    
- Even though Lake Nipissing looks big, compared to the **Great Lakes** nearby, it was considered a “smaller water.”
    
- The French name “Nipissing” comes directly from this Ojibwe word.

👥 The people are called **Nbisiing Anishinaabeg** — the Anishinaabe people of Nbisiing (Lake Nipissing).

So when you hear **Nipissing**, you’re really hearing a French version of the Ojibwe name **Nbisiing**, which reflects how the Anishinaabe described their homeland.

Would you like me to also show you how to **pronounce Nbisiing** in Ojibwe?
